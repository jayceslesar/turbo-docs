# README.md

This repository contains a generate.py file that takes a directory of files and creates a README.md from them using an OpenAI GPT-3 API. It also includes a requirements.txt file that lists the necessary dependencies, along with two utility files for cli_options.py and directory.py. The generate.py file takes two optional command line arguments, --to_clipboard and --git_operations, which can be used to copy the directory text to your clipboard and/or perform git operations after the README.md is generated. 

Using this repository, you can quickly create a README.md file for any project with just a few simple commands. 

To use generate.py, first make sure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Then, run generate.py with the --to_clipboard and --git_operations flags if desired. The generate.py file will then use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a README.md based on the structure of the current repository and any flags specified. 

If the --git_operations flag was specified, then the generate.py file will commit and push the new README.md to the repository. Now, you have a README.md file that accurately reflects the structure and contents of the repository for people to explore. 

Happy coding!
