## function: readme
#### args: repo, gpt3=False, template=TEMPLATE
Generate a README.md file for the current repository by choosing between GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models. The function takes the repository name as the 'repo' argument and allows for overriding the default template. If the 'gpt3' argument is set to True, the GPT-3.5 Turbo model is used; otherwise, the GPT-4 model is used. The generated README.md file is saved in the current repository.
