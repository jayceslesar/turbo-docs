## function: resolve_model
#### args: gpt3
The function `resolve_model` is used to determine the model to be used based on the boolean value of the argument `gpt3`. If `gpt3` is True, it sets the model to 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', otherwise it sets the model to 'gpt-4' and prints a warning about the limited availability and slower speed of the GPT-4 model. The function then prints the model being used and returns the model name.

## function: num_tokens_from_string
#### args: string, encoding_name
This function returns the number of tokens in a given text string. It uses the specified encoding name to encode the string and count the tokens, defaulting to 'cl100k_base' if no encoding name is provided. The function allows all special characters during encoding, providing a comprehensive token count.

## function: driver
#### args: copy, readme, gpt3, docs, narrative
The `driver` function pulls text from all files in the current directory and applies a series of commands based on the boolean arguments provided. These commands include copying the text to the clipboard, generating a README.md file, using GPT-3.5-turbo-16k, and generating documentation for each file. This function is particularly useful for maintaining up-to-date documentation and working with ChatGPT.
